## Tech Stack
- Angular 19
- Angular Material (or alternative UI library)
- RxJS for state management

git clone https://github.com/your-username/event-booking-frontend.git
cd event-booking-frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Configuration

Create an environment file at `src/environments/environment.ts` with your backend API URL:
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://your-backend-api-url.com/api',
  authUrl: 'http://your-backend-api-url.com/auth'
};
```

## Development Server
